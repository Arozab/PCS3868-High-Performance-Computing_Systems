# High performance Computing Systems

This is a repository for my High Performance Computing Systems class. The lectures consisted in both theoretical and practical ones. This is the compilation for all code that I developed while a student in this class. 

The repository is divided in folders for each lesson. In every folder, there is the material provided by teacher and personal notes, and the code itself for solving most of the times two exercises on the lecture's topic.
